===============
"browser" \| "crawler" = "brozzler"

Brozzler is a distributed web crawler (爬虫) that uses a real browser (chrome
or chromium) to fetch pages and embedded urls and to extract links. It also
uses `youtube-dl <https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl>`_ to enhance media
capture capabilities.

Brozzler is designed to work in conjunction with
`warcprox <https://github.com/internetarchive/warcprox>`_ for web
archiving.

Requirements
------------

- Python 3.4 or later
- RethinkDB deployment
- Chromium or Google Chrome browser

Worth noting is that the browser requires a graphical environment to run. You
already have this on your laptop, but on a server it will probably require
deploying some additional infrastructure (typically X11). The vagrant
configuration in the brozzler repository (still a work in progress) has an
example setup.

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started with brozzler for web archiving is with
``brozzler-easy``. Brozzler-easy runs brozzler-worker, warcprox,
`pywb <https://github.com/ikreymer/pywb>`_, and brozzler-dashboard, configured
to work with each other, in a single process.

Mac instructions:

::

    # install and start rethinkdb
    brew install rethinkdb
    # no brew? try rethinkdb's installer: https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/osx/
    rethinkdb &>>rethinkdb.log &

    # install brozzler with special dependencies pywb and warcprox
    pip3 install brozzler[easy]  # in a virtualenv if desired

    # queue a site to crawl
    brozzler-new-site http://example.com/

    # or a job
    brozzler-new-job job1.yml

    # start brozzler-easy
    brozzler-easy

At this point brozzler-easy will start brozzling your site. Results will be
immediately available for playback in pywb at http://localhost:8880/brozzler/.

*Brozzler-easy demonstrates the full brozzler archival crawling workflow, but
does not take advantage of brozzler's distributed nature.*

Installation and Usage
----------------------

To install brozzler only:

::

    pip3 install brozzler  # in a virtualenv if desired

Launch one or more workers:

::

    brozzler-worker --warcprox-auto

Submit jobs:

::

    brozzler-new-job myjob.yaml

Submit sites not tied to a job:

::

    brozzler-new-site --time-limit=600 http://example.com/

Job Configuration
-----------------

Jobs are defined using yaml files. Options may be specified either at the
top-level or on individual seeds. At least one seed url must be specified,
everything else is optional. For details, see `<job-conf.rst>`_.

::

    id: myjob
    time_limit: 60 # seconds
    proxy: 127.0.0.1:8000 # point at warcprox for archiving
    ignore_robots: false
    warcprox_meta: null
    metadata: {}
    seeds:
      - url: http://one.example.org/
      - url: http://two.example.org/
        time_limit: 30
      - url: http://three.example.org/
        time_limit: 10
        ignore_robots: true
        scope:
          surt: http://(org,example,

Brozzler Dashboard
------------------

Brozzler comes with a rudimentary web application for viewing crawl job status.
To install the brozzler with dependencies required to run this app, run

::

    pip install brozzler[dashboard]


To start the app, run

::

    brozzler-dashboard

See ``brozzler-dashboard --help`` for configuration options.

Brozzler Wayback
----------------

Brozzler comes with a customized version of
`pywb <https://github.com/ikreymer/pywb>`_ which supports using the rethinkdb
"captures" table (populated by warcprox) as its index.

To use, first install dependencies.

::

    pip install brozzler[easy]

Write a configuration file pywb.yml.

::

    # 'archive_paths' should point to the output directory of warcprox
    archive_paths: warcs/  # pywb will fail without a trailing slash
    collections:
      brozzler:
        index_paths: !!python/object:brozzler.pywb.RethinkCDXSource
          db: brozzler
          table: captures
          servers:
          - localhost
    enable_auto_colls: false
    enable_cdx_api: true
    framed_replay: true
    port: 8880

Run pywb like so:

::

    $ PYWB_CONFIG_FILE=pywb.yml brozzler-wayback

Then browse http://localhost:8880/brozzler/.


Headless Chrome (experimental)
--------------------------------

`Headless Chromium <https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/headless/README.md>`_
is now available in stable Chrome releases for 64-bit Linux and may be
used to run the browser without a visibe window or X11 at all.

To try this out, create a wrapper script like ~/bin/chrome-headless.sh:

::

    #!/bin/bash
    exec /opt/google/chrome/chrome --headless --disable-gpu "$@"

Run brozzler passing the path to the wrapper script as the ``--chrome-exe``
option:

::

    chmod +x ~/bin/chrome-headless.sh
    brozzler-worker --chrome-exe ~/bin/chrome-headless.sh

Beware: Chrome's headless mode is still very new and has a number of
`unresolved issues. <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&q=Proj%3DHeadless>`_
You may experience hangs or crashes with some types of content. Brozzler
has not had much testing with it. For the moment we recommend using
Chrome's regular mode instead.
