===============

"browser" \| "crawler" = "brozzler"

Brozzler is a distributed web crawler (爬虫) that uses a real browser (chrome
or chromium) to fetch pages and embedded urls and to extract links. It also
uses `youtube-dl <https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl>`_ to enhance media
capture capabilities.

Brozzler is designed to work in conjunction with
`warcprox <https://github.com/internetarchive/warcprox>`_ for web
archiving.

Requirements
------------

- Python 3.4 or later
- RethinkDB deployment
- Chromium or Google Chrome browser

Worth noting is that the browser requires a graphical environment to run. You
already have this on your laptop, but on a server it will probably require
deploying some additional infrastructure (typically X11). The vagrant
configuration in the brozzler repository (still a work in progress) has an
example setup.

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started with brozzler for web archiving is with
``brozzler-easy``. Brozzler-easy runs brozzler-worker, warcprox,
`pywb <https://github.com/ikreymer/pywb>`_, and brozzler-webconsole, configured
to work with each other, in a single process.

Mac instructions:

::

    # install and start rethinkdb
    brew install rethinkdb
    rethinkdb &>>rethinkdb.log &

    # install brozzler with special dependencies pywb and warcprox
    pip3 install brozzler[easy]  # in a virtualenv if desired

    # queue a site to crawl
    brozzler-new-site http://example.com/

    # or a job
    brozzler-new-job job1.yml

    # start brozzler-easy
    brozzler-easy

At this point brozzler-easy will start brozzling your site. Results will be
immediately available for playback in pywb at http://localhost:8091/brozzler/.

*Brozzler-easy demonstrates the full brozzler archival crawling workflow, but
does not take advantage of brozzler's distributed nature.*

Installation and Usage
----------------------

To install brozzler only:

::

    pip3 install brozzler  # in a virtualenv if desired

Launch one or more workers:

::

    brozzler-worker

Submit jobs:

::

    brozzler-new-job myjob.yaml

Submit sites not tied to a job:

::

    brozzler-new-site --proxy=localhost:8000 --enable-warcprox-features \
        --time-limit=600 http://example.com/

Job Configuration
-----------------

Jobs are defined using yaml files. Options may be specified either at the
top-level or on individual seeds. A job id and at least one seed url
must be specified, everything else is optional.

::

    id: myjob
    time_limit: 60 # seconds
    proxy: 127.0.0.1:8000 # point at warcprox for archiving
    ignore_robots: false
    enable_warcprox_features: false
    warcprox_meta: null
    metadata: {}
    seeds:
      - url: http://one.example.org/
      - url: http://two.example.org/
        time_limit: 30
      - url: http://three.example.org/
        time_limit: 10
        ignore_robots: true
        scope:
          surt: http://(org,example,

Brozzler Web Console
--------------------

Brozzler comes with a rudimentary web application for viewing crawl job status.
To install the brozzler with dependencies required to run this app, run

::

    pip install brozzler[webconsole]


To start the app, run

::

    brozzler-webconsole

See ``brozzler-webconsole --help`` for configuration options.
